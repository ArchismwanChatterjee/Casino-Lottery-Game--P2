# Project based on Lottery Games in the Casino's using C language

# The user must know and follow these rules:

 1) ABOVE  20 Years of AGE
 2) YOUR BALANCE MUST BE GREATER THAN YOUR BID
 3) THE 3 DIGIT NUMBER ON THE SCREEN IS GENERATED RANDOMLY
 4) EACH TOKEN IS VALUED AT RS.1
 5) MAINTAIN CODE OF CONDUCT
 
# The game conditions are
<h3> 999: JACKPOT
<h3> 000: LOST ALL 
<h3> XXX: 3X BID VALUE
<h3> AXX: 2X BID VALUE
<h3> ALL ODD DIGITS : DRAW
<h3> ALL EVEN DIGITS : DRAW
<h3> OTHER: LOST BID

# HOW TO PLAY 
<p> The user must be above the age limit to play. He/She needs to purchase tokens(choices available to convert extra amount to tokens or take the change). The user has the option to quit the game before spin of the numbers. As the number is generated randomly by the system there is no chance of any biased gameplay towards any user or condition. All the conditions have more or less equal probability.Also every user will have different sets of number generated.The House balance is fixed at Rs.10000. If the house balance becomes zero at any point then the game will stop. The users will also have the option to refill their balance if that reaches zero at certain point and the user is also willing to play further. If the user doesnot maintain the code of conduct then the user will be not allowed to play and the system will stop at that instant.<p>
